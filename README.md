# Disease-modelling-
Infer whether a disease is present from the medications taken by a individual. Also look for associations/patterns to see if a particular drug is preferred by a certain demographic subgroup.  

Data sets given :
Meps_Base - Dimension level data for all individuals in the study (eg Demographics etc)
Meps_Meds - Transactional level dataset for each medicine taken by a individual within the study period

Given the meps_base_data & meps_meds data sets:
● What are the most common medications for each disease in the base file?
● What medications are most indicative of each disease?
● Choose ONE of the diseases and build a model to infer whether that disease is present
from the medications.
● Demonstrate that the end user should be confident in the result.
● Can you find any evidence that for the disease you’ve modeled, a certain drug is preferred
by a certain demographic subgroup?
